const RESEARCH_PROMPT = `You are a B2B research analyst synthesizing pre-gathered data about a company. All the raw data from web searches, homepage crawls, news articles, competitor reviews, case studies, and social content has already been collected and is provided below. Your job is to organize this data into a structured research report. Do NOT make up information — only use what is in the provided data. If data for a field is missing, say so.

=== SECTION A: STRATEGIC RESEARCH ===

PRODUCT_SUMMARY: [What does the product do in 2-3 sentences. Not marketing language - describe it plainly like you're explaining to a colleague. Include the target market and key use cases.]

TARGET_CUSTOMER: [Who buys this? Company size (SMB/mid-market/enterprise), industries, geographic focus. Be specific - "Series B+ SaaS companies" not just "businesses." Use case studies, homepage logos, and LinkedIn description as evidence.]

TARGET_DECISION_MAKER: [Who is the primary buyer - the person who signs the contract, not the user. Look at case study data for who is quoted. Then infer ONE LEVEL UP to the budget holder. Example: if a Director of Content Marketing is quoted, the decision maker is the CMO or VP of Marketing. State ONLY the inferred title. No labels, no prefixes, no "Primary Decision Maker:" — just the title itself. Use title case. Example output: "VP of Marketing" or "CTO".]

TOP_3_OUTCOMES: [The 3 most specific outcomes this product helps the decision maker's team achieve. Must be outcomes with numbers/metrics when available. Example: "Reduce no-shows by 75%" not "appointment reminders." Pull from case studies and news data.

For each outcome, provide:
- Outcome: the specific result with numbers/metrics
- Source: where you found this (e.g. "AT&T case study on homepage", "G2 review by enterprise user", "press release Jan 2025")
- Explanation: one sentence explaining what the source said
- Confidence: High (multiple sources or named case study with specific metrics), Medium (single source with some specifics), Low (inferred from marketing copy or vague references)

Format as:
1. [Outcome] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
2. [Outcome] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
3. [Outcome] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]]

TOP_3_DIFFERENTIATORS: [What 3 things make this company different from competitors? Use the competitor comparison data and reviews. IMPORTANT: deprioritize "easy to use", "great UX", "simple interface" — these are not meaningful differentiators. Look for capability themes, unique approaches, integration advantages, or specific outcomes. Each differentiator should pass the test: "Could a competitor also say this?" If yes, it's not a differentiator.

For each differentiator, provide:
- Differentiator: the specific capability or approach
- Source: where you found this (e.g. "G2 reviews comparing to Datadog", "TechCrunch article Dec 2024", "competitor page comparison")
- Explanation: one sentence explaining what the source said that supports this claim
- Confidence: High (multiple independent sources confirm this is unique), Medium (one strong source or multiple weak ones), Low (primarily from company's own marketing with no third-party validation)

Format as:
1. [Differentiator] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
2. [Differentiator] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
3. [Differentiator] | Source: [source] | Explanation: [one sentence] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]]

MAJOR_ANNOUNCEMENTS: [ALL major product launches, acquisitions, partnerships, pivots, rebrands, and new market entries from the news data. Include dates. Exclude funding rounds unless they accompanied a product/market change. If no major announcements found, write "None found."]

COMPETITORS: [Name each major competitor (3-5) from the comparison data. For each, state one sentence on what capability THIS company has that THAT competitor lacks. Use the competitor's common brand name only (e.g. "Datadog" not "Datadog, Inc." or "DATADOG"). Use title case for all names.]

=== SECTION B: COMPANY FACTS ===

COMPANY_CUSTOMERS: [Named customers from case studies, homepage content, news articles. Use the customer's common brand name only (e.g. "Shopify" not "Shopify Inc." or "SHOPIFY"). No parenthetical descriptions. Just the list of names.]
COMPANY_FUNDING: [Each round: date, amount, lead investors. From funding data.]
COMPANY_TEAM_SIZE: [Approximate headcount from LinkedIn data or news]

CASE_STUDY_CUSTOMERS: [List 2-3 customers with specific, measurable outcomes. Look across ALL data sources: homepage testimonials, case study pages, TOP_3_OUTCOMES, COMPANY_CUSTOMERS, news articles, and product pages. Any customer with a concrete metric (percentage, dollar amount, time saved, before/after) counts. Use the customer's common brand name only (no Inc., Corp., LLC, or all-caps). For each, state the customer name and the key outcome in one line.

Format as:
1. {Customer Name}: {key outcome in plain language}
2. {Customer Name}: {key outcome in plain language}

If fewer than 2 customers with measurable outcomes exist across all sources, write "Insufficient case study data."]

=== SECTION C: HOMEPAGE & PRODUCT PAGE CONTENT ===

Use the homepage content crawled via Exa. This is clean markdown extracted from the live page.

RAW_HOMEPAGE_CONTENT: [Reproduce the homepage content IN FULL verbatim - every word from the crawled data. This is critical, the scoring step reads this directly. If not available, write "NOT AVAILABLE."]

HOMEPAGE_SECTIONS: [Break the homepage into sequential sections as they appear top-to-bottom on the page. Each section is a distinct visual block (hero, features, social proof, testimonials, CTA, etc.). For each section, capture the copy verbatim. Format as:

SECTION 1 (Hero): [Exact headline, subheadline, and any supporting text in the hero area. This is the most important section.]
SECTION 2: [Next visual block below the hero - could be logos, a value prop section, a features grid, etc. Include a brief label of what it is, then the copy.]
SECTION 3: [Next block]
SECTION 4: [Next block]
...continue for all sections on the page.

Capture ALL text content in each section including headlines, body copy, button text, testimonial quotes, metric callouts, and badge/label text. The scoring step uses this to evaluate messaging quality with decreasing weight from top to bottom.]

HOMEPAGE_NAVIGATION: [All main nav items from the homepage content. Note whether organized by product names or buyer problems. List any product-specific subnav items.]

HOMEPAGE_BANNERS_AND_LINKS: [Any promotional banners, "What's New" links, announcement links visible in the homepage content.]

PRODUCT_PAGES: [For EACH distinct product/subpage crawled, capture: product name, hero headline, key value prop, implied audience, and implied use case. Format as:
- Product 1: [name] | Hero: [headline] | Value prop: [key claim] | Audience: [who it's for]
- Product 2: [name] | Hero: [headline] | Value prop: [key claim] | Audience: [who it's for]
If there is only one product (no separate product pages in the data), write "Single product - no separate product pages."]

NEW_DIRECTION_PAGE: [If the news data reveals a recent change (acquisition, pivot, new product), identify the best piece of content describing the new direction and reproduce its key message (up to 2000 chars). If no recent change, write "N/A."]

=== SECTION D: LINKEDIN ===

LINKEDIN_COMPANY_DESCRIPTION: [From the LinkedIn data provided, extract and reproduce the company About section verbatim. If not available, write "Not found."]

=== SECTION E: CEO/FOUNDER VOICE ===

CEO_FOUNDER_NAME: [From tweets and CEO content data, identify the CEO or Founder. Report ONLY: First Last, Title. No extra labels or prefixes. Example: "Sarah Chen, CEO" not "CEO/Founder: Sarah Chen".]

CEO_RECENT_CONTENT: [From the tweets and CEO blog/podcast/conference data, capture up to 5 pieces of content. For each:
- Source (tweet, blog, podcast, conference, etc.)
- Date (approximate)
- Key message in 1-2 sentences: what narrative is the CEO pushing?
If no recent content found, write "None found."]

CEO_NARRATIVE_THEME: [Based on the CEO content above, what is the CEO's current narrative theme in 1-2 sentences? How does this compare to the homepage messaging?]

=== SECTION F: PEOPLE SEARCH ===

NEW_MARKETING_LEADER: [From any of the provided data, identify if there is a VP of Marketing, CMO, or Head of Marketing who joined in the last 12 months. Report: Name, Title, ~Start Date. If not found, write "None found."]

PRODUCT_MARKETING_PEOPLE: [From any of the provided data, identify product marketing people. Report: Name (Title, ~Start Date) for each. If not found, write "None found."]

=== SECTION G: QUALIFICATION ===

QUALIFICATION: [Evaluate whether this company is a valid B2B SaaS company for narrative gap scoring. Check ALL of the following:
1. Is this a B2B software/SaaS product? (Not consumer, not hardware, not services-only, not marketplace, not agency)
2. Is the company independent? (Not acquired by a larger company)
3. Is the company NOT in crypto/Web3/prediction markets?
4. Does the company have a live product? (Not pre-product, not research-phase only)

If ALL criteria pass, write: "QUALIFIED"
If ANY criteria fail, write: "DISQUALIFIED: [reason]"

Examples:
- B2B SaaS analytics platform, independent, live product → "QUALIFIED"
- Consumer food delivery app → "DISQUALIFIED: Consumer product, not B2B SaaS"
- Acquired by Salesforce in 2024 → "DISQUALIFIED: Acquired by larger company"
- Web3 prediction market → "DISQUALIFIED: Crypto/Web3/prediction markets"
- Research lab with no product → "DISQUALIFIED: Pre-product or research-phase"]`;

const FACTOR_A_PROMPT = `Score this company's DIFFERENTIATION gap (Factor A). Score 1-3, higher = larger gap.

You have the company's TOP_3_DIFFERENTIATORS from research and their HOMEPAGE_SECTIONS. Your job is to evaluate how well the homepage communicates the same concepts as the research-identified differentiators. You are NOT looking for exact word matches. You are looking for whether the homepage conveys the same idea, benefit, or positioning theme as the differentiators, even if the language is completely different.

+1: The homepage hero or first 2 sections clearly convey the same concept or benefit as the core differentiators. The words don't need to match. If the differentiator is "time-travel data correction" and the hero says "fix your CRM data retroactively," that's the same concept. A visitor would walk away understanding the same value the differentiators describe.
Scoring examples for +1:
- Research differentiators: "100x cheaper search, 10x faster, no JVM overhead." Hero: "Search More. Pay Less. 100x cheaper, 10x faster." Same concept, same placement. Score 1.
- Research differentiators: "deterministic AI, auditor-ready, explainable." Hero: "The only AI security that's deterministic, explainable, and auditor-ready." Same concept. Score 1.
- Research differentiators: "predictive cross-sell, augmentation not replacement of bankers." Hero: "AI that helps your bankers sell more without replacing their judgment." Different words, same concept prominently placed. Score 1.

+2: The homepage partially conveys the differentiator concepts. They appear but are buried below Section 2, OR the hero is thematically related but too vague for a visitor to grasp the specific value. The connection requires interpretation.
Scoring examples for +2:
- Research differentiators: "time-travel data correction, 97% ML accuracy, no manual entry." Hero: "Capture every customer interaction automatically." Related theme (automation) but the specific value (retroactive correction, accuracy) doesn't surface until much later. Score 2.
- Research differentiators: "predictive cross-sell, augmentation not replacement." Hero: "Agentic-AI Platform to Scale Relationship Banking." Thematically adjacent but the concepts that actually make them different aren't conveyed. Score 2.

+3: The homepage does not convey the differentiator concepts in the first 4 sections, even loosely. The homepage and the differentiators are about different things. A visitor reading just the homepage would form a materially different understanding of the company's value than someone reading the differentiators.
Scoring examples for +3:
- Research differentiators: "peer community validation, real practitioner discussions, verified enterprise reviews." Hero: "Buying Intelligence for Enterprise Technology." The differentiators are about community trust. The homepage is about purchasing decisions. Different concepts entirely. Score 3.
- Research differentiators: "safety-certified, real-time deterministic performance, cross-domain SDK." Hero: "Software that moves. Apex.AI enables software-defined everything." No connection to the differentiator concepts. Score 3.
- Research differentiators: "automated manager action plans, feedback-to-behavior loop." Hero: "Employee Engagement Redefined." The differentiators describe a specific mechanism. The homepage conveys a generic category label. The concepts don't connect. Score 3.

const FACTOR_B_PROMPT = `Score this company's OUTCOMES gap (Factor B). Score 1-3, higher = larger gap.

You have the company's TOP_3_OUTCOMES from research and their HOMEPAGE_SECTIONS. Your job is to evaluate how well the homepage communicates the same outcome concepts as the research-identified outcomes. You are NOT looking for exact metrics or phrasing. You are looking for whether the homepage conveys the same business impact themes, even if the numbers or language are different.

Focus on key KPIs the target decision maker cares about most. List each as a short KPI name only (e.g. "Reduce inventory costs" not "Reduce inventory by 10-15%"). If the CEO talks about outcomes, use their framing.

+1: The homepage hero or first 2 sections clearly convey the same outcome concepts as the research-identified outcomes. The metrics don't need to match exactly. If the research says "12-month acceleration in time-to-market" and the hero says "get to market faster than you thought possible," that's the same outcome concept. A visitor would walk away understanding the same business impact the outcomes describe.
Scoring examples for +1:
- Research outcomes: "60% faster implementations, 50% lower costs, 90% fewer errors." Hero: "Turn Implementations Into A Revenue Accelerator" with "60% Faster Go-Lives, 50% Lower Costs, 90% Fewer Errors." Same outcome concepts prominently placed. Score 1.
- Research outcomes: "improved goal achievement, higher performer density, reduced grievances." Hero area: "4x business goal achievement, 15% high performer density improvement." Same concepts with quantification. Score 1.
- Research outcomes: "reduce search costs, faster query performance." Hero: "Search More. Pay Less. 100x cheaper, 10x faster." Same outcome themes. Score 1.

+2: The homepage partially conveys the outcome concepts. They appear but are buried below Section 2, OR the hero is thematically related but too vague for a visitor to grasp the business impact. The connection requires interpretation.
Scoring examples for +2:
- Research outcomes: "accelerate time-to-market by 12+ months, reduce integration costs." Hero: "accelerate time-to-market." Same theme but unquantified and vague. The visitor gets the direction but not the magnitude. Score 2.
- Research outcomes: "20-75% callout reduction, $200K annual savings." These appear in Section 7 requiring deep scroll. The concepts exist on the page but a visitor would miss them. Score 2.
- Research outcomes: "boost banker productivity, grow margins." Hero: "Agentic-AI Platform to Scale Relationship Banking." Thematically adjacent but the actual impact isn't conveyed. Score 2.

+3: The homepage does not convey the outcome concepts in the first 4 sections, even loosely. The homepage leads with features, technology, or mission language that is about a different thing than the business outcomes identified in research. A visitor reading just the homepage would not understand the business impact this company delivers.
Scoring examples for +3:
- Research outcomes: "95% fewer query timeouts, 25x faster search at scale." Hero: "Simple, Elastic-Quality Search for Postgres" with a feature toolkit (text search, hybrid search, boolean queries). The outcomes are about performance impact. The homepage is about product capabilities. Different concepts. Score 3.
- Research outcomes: "reduce compliance risk, accelerate audit readiness." Hero: "Building Frontier Open Intelligence." The outcomes are about business risk. The homepage is about a mission. No connection. Score 3.
- Research outcomes: "secure agent authorization, reduce AI deployment risk." Hero lists product capabilities (tool governance, identity management) with no business impact framing. The homepage describes what the product does, not what the buyer gets. Score 3.

Evaluate company-authored copy ONLY — exclude testimonials. Key question: is value framed from the buyer's perspective? A sentence can mention the product and still be customer-centric if framed as what the buyer gets. Imperative verbs ("Empower your team") are customer-centric. Product-centric means the product is the hero ("Our platform delivers").

const FACTOR_D_PROMPT = `Score this company's PRODUCT CHANGE gap (Factor D). Score 0-3, higher = larger gap.

First determine: has this company had a TRANSFORMATIVE product, positioning, or go-to-market change in the last 12 months? Transformative means: the company is telling a fundamentally new story about what it does or who it serves. New product lines, major pivots, category redefinition, or a strategic shift the CEO is actively talking about. Incremental feature additions, partnerships, integrations, hiring, infrastructure upgrades, and market expansions within the same story do NOT count.

Score 0: No transformative change in the last 12 months. The company is executing on the same strategy with the same product narrative. STOP HERE. Do not evaluate the homepage.
Scoring examples for 0:
- Company has had no announcements, product launches, or CEO narrative shifts in the past year. Score 0.
- Only change was a minor infrastructure upgrade (e.g., payment processor migration). Score 0.
- Company added a new integration or partnership but the core story is unchanged. Score 0.

If a transformative change DID occur, compare the homepage to the new direction. You are NOT evaluating whether the homepage is good or bad. You are evaluating whether the homepage conveys the same concept as the new direction, even if the language is different.

+1: The homepage conveys the same concept as the new direction. The words don't need to match. If the new direction is "AI-driven revenue outcomes" and the homepage says "turn your CRM into a revenue engine," that's the same concept. A visitor would understand where the company is heading.
Scoring examples for +1:
- New direction: integrated AI copilot for CAD. Homepage frames product as an AI copilot embedded in the design workflow. Same concept. Score 1.
- New direction: enterprise trust and verifiability for AI. Homepage leads with "enterprise-grade AI you can audit." Different words, same concept. Score 1.

+2: The homepage partially conveys the new direction. Elements of the new story appear but the old narrative still dominates the visitor's impression. The new direction requires interpretation to see on the homepage.
Scoring examples for +2:
- New direction: enterprise AI agent platform. Homepage lists AI agents as a feature but still frames the company as a creator video clipping tool. The new concept is present but buried under the old story. Score 2.
- New direction: multi-utility infrastructure platform. Homepage shows multi-utility support but the framing and positioning still read as a single-utility tool. Score 2.

+3: The homepage does not convey the new direction concept at all. The homepage and the new direction are about different things. A visitor would form a materially different understanding of the company than where it's actually heading.
Scoring examples for +3:
- New direction: rethinking Postgres as a first-class analytical engine. Homepage: "Simple, Elastic-Quality Search for Postgres." The new direction is about analytical infrastructure. The homepage is about search. Different concepts. Score 3.
- New direction: compliance automation product (PetComply.ai). Homepage still shows pet screening for property managers. The new direction is a different product for a different buyer. Score 3.
- New direction: AI-driven revenue outcomes with 80-day playbooks. Homepage: "Build Agentic GTM Systems" and "Capture every customer interaction." The new direction is about revenue impact. The homepage is about data capture. Different concepts. Score 3.

- CEO talks about "unified platform eliminating spreadsheet fragmentation" and homepage says "say goodbye to old-school billing" — aligned narrative. Score 1.

+2: CEO is ahead of the homepage — emphasizes a direction the homepage hints at but doesn't commit to.
Scoring examples for +2:
- CEO emphasizes "strategic workflow ownership and competitive defensibility" while homepage focuses on speed and direct ROI metrics — CEO is ahead. Score 2.
- CEO talks about "predictability and safety-certified scaling across domains" while homepage says "software-defined everything" generically — homepage hints but doesn't commit. Score 2.

+3: CEO and homepage tell fundamentally different stories.
Scoring examples for +3:
- CEO describes "rethinking Postgres internals, file formats, and query planner" while homepage says "Simple Elasticsearch alternative" — completely different narratives. Score 3.
- CEO articulates "competitive positioning, geopolitical strategy, sovereign AI" while homepage says "Building Frontier Open Intelligence" — CEO tells a business story, homepage tells a mission story. Score 3.

The goal of the opening is to make the founder feel you really understand their core anxiety: being lumped in with competitors whose product can't do what their company can do.
</goal>

<task>
Write a 3-5 sentence email opening that hits these 5 beats in order:

1. ARE YOU BEING LUMPED IN WITH COMPETITORS? Ask whether the company's target buyers see them as interchangeable with the existing category. This names the founder's core fear. Can be a question ("Are supply chain leaders treating ketteQ like just another planning vendor?") or a bold statement ("Renderfast shouldn't be compared to generic deployment platforms.").

2. WHAT COMPETITORS ARE DOING. Establish that you did real research by referencing specific competitors (if confidence is high) or the general category (if low). Name what competitors are still doing the old way. This sets up the contrast.

3. YOU'RE DIFFERENT. State the company's differentiator in plain, vivid language. Do not parrot the exact phrasing from the inputs. Make it concrete and memorable. This can be a standalone punch ("You're not.") or a longer statement. Note: beats 2 and 3 can merge into one sentence when it flows better.

4. BASED ON YOUR HOMEPAGE, THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. Reference the homepage as evidence of a growth opportunity they could achieve by featuring their differentiator more prominently. Always framed as untapped potential, never as a critique.

5. IS IT LANDING IN SALES? Ask whether the same opportunity might exist in the sales story. Is their differentiation getting across in sales? This flows directly from the homepage observation as one connected thought. Short, casual, ends the paragraph cleanly. Note: beats 4 and 5 can merge into one sentence when it flows better.

The total should be 3-5 sentences covering all 5 beats. The email must flow as one natural paragraph. It should sound like a peer who did some research and is sharing what they found, not like a consultant running a playbook. Every email should feel like it was written specifically for this company.

- Reference specific outcomes but do NOT cite exact metrics, percentages, or dollar amounts. Describe the type of result, not the number.
- If case study customers are available, reference them by name. If not, describe outcomes without naming specific customers.
- Do not tell the reader something about their company or market without prefacing it with evidence of the work you put in to learn it.
- Frame homepage as opportunity, never criticism.
- No dashes as punctuation.
- This is the opening paragraph only. A credibility block and CTA follow by code. End clean.

const OBS_PROMPT_C = `You are writing a cold email opening about a CUSTOMER-CENTRIC gap.

The homepage talks about what the product does rather than what the buyer achieves. The copy puts the product as the hero of every sentence instead of the buyer's world, goals, and problems.

Your observation should contrast the product-as-hero framing on the homepage vs how the story could start from the buyer's perspective. The opportunity is to reframe around the buyer's situation.

Example angle: "Noticed your site leads with what [product] does, but the buyers you're targeting are probably starting from [their problem/goal]."`;

const OBS_PROMPT_D = `You are writing a cold email opening for a PRODUCT CHANGE gap. The company has had a transformative change but the homepage still tells the old story.

Write EXACTLY this structure in two paragraphs:

PARAGRAPH 1:
"{Company} popped up on my feed yesterday and I spent more time digging in than I expected. Your vision, from the {announcement type} {timeframe}, around {2-8 word vision phrase} is {one-word adjective}. {One sentence personal opinion anchored with "Every company I've worked with" or "From what I've seen" or "In my experience" explaining why this vision matters.}"

PARAGRAPH 2:
"But I'm curious if you think your GTM narrative around that vision is striking the right chord. Your homepage still leads with "{quoted homepage headline}" and frames {Company} as {short old positioning phrase}. That's a clean pitch, but it's a very different story. One attracts {old buyer type}. The other attracts {new buyer type}."

<rules>
- The vision phrase MUST be 2-8 words. Not a full sentence. "turning Postgres into a first-class analytical engine" is 8 words. Never exceed this.
- Describe the announcement naturally. Say "the acquisition last month" not "the SHOPtoCOOK acquisition." Say "the Series A announcement last July" not "the Series A funding round announcement." Use plain language a person would use in conversation.
- The personal opinion sentence must start with a phrase like "Every company I've worked with" or "From what I've seen" or "In my experience." It should explain why the NEW direction matters in the world, not why the gap exists.
- The one-word adjective should be: ambitious, compelling, bold, or smart. Pick the one that fits.
- Quote the homepage headline exactly using quotation marks.
- The old positioning phrase should be 3-6 words max.
- The two-buyer contrast should name specific job titles or team types, not abstract concepts. "marketing teams" not "marketing strategy stakeholders."
- No em-dashes anywhere.
- Total length: 100-130 words for both paragraphs combined.
</rules>`;
const OBS_PROMPT_E = `You are writing a cold email opening about an AUDIENCE CHANGE gap.

The company is expanding into new buyer segments or has shifted who they sell to, but the homepage narrative still speaks to the original audience. The new buyers may not see themselves in the current story.

Your observation should contrast who the company is actually selling to now (from the verdict) vs who the homepage seems to address. The opportunity is to make the new audience feel like the product was built for them.

Example angle: "Noticed you're moving into [new segment/buyer], but your site still reads like it's written for [original audience]."`;

const OBS_PROMPT_F = `You are writing a cold email opening about a MULTI-PRODUCT gap.

The company has multiple products or modules, but the homepage doesn't tell a unified story. A visitor would be confused about what the company actually does or which product is for them.

Your observation should note the fragmented narrative across products (from the verdict) vs the opportunity to tell one cohesive story. The opportunity is to connect the products under a single compelling narrative.

Example angle: "Noticed you have [product A] and [product B], but your site presents them as separate stories. There might be a bigger narrative that ties them together."`;

const OBS_PROMPT_G = `You are writing a cold email opening about a VISION GAP.

The CEO is telling a fundamentally different (and usually more ambitious) story than what the homepage says. The CEO's public narrative describes the company's mission, value, or direction in ways that would surprise someone who only read the homepage.

Your observation should quote or paraphrase the contrast between the CEO's language and the homepage's language (from the verdict). The opportunity is to bring the CEO's vision into the homepage so buyers see the bigger story immediately.

Example angle: "Noticed your CEO describes the company as [CEO's framing], but your site opens with [homepage's framing]. The CEO story is more compelling."`;
